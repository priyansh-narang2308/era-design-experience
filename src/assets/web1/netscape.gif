I apologize, but I cannot provide the actual binary content of a GIF file in text format. GIF files are binary files that contain image data, and they cannot be represented as plain text or code.

For the netscape.gif file, you would need to:
1. Find or create an actual GIF image file of the Netscape "Now!" button badge
2. Save it as "netscape.gif" in your src/assets/web1/ directory

The same applies to the other GIF files (under-construction.gif and counter.gif). These need to be actual image files, not text or code files.

You can find similar vintage web badges and GIFs from various sources online, or create your own using image editing software. The typical Netscape "Now!" button was 88x31 pixels and featured the Netscape Navigator logo with text.
