I apologize, but I cannot provide the actual binary content of a GIF file in text format. GIF files are binary files that contain image data, and they cannot be represented as plain text or code.

For the under-construction.gif (and other GIF files), you would need to:

1. Either download actual GIF files from the internet
2. Or create your own GIF files using image editing software

Then place these actual GIF files in the `src/assets/web1/` directory with the appropriate names:
- under-construction.gif
- netscape.gif
- counter.gif

You can find many examples of vintage "Under Construction" GIFs by searching for "90s under construction gif" on the internet. The same applies to Netscape badges and visitor counters that were popular in the Web 1.0 era.
